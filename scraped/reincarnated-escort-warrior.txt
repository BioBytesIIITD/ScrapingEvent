My dream is to become an escort warrior that rides on a cool horse and transports goods. But I’ve got a limp leg and I’m unable to learn decent martial arts. I’ve lived as a porter working odd jobs for the entirety of my life. Until I died because of the mountain bandits that I met during an escort mission. But… ‘I became the fourth young master, Lee Jungryong?!’ When I died and woke up, I was reborn as the Heavenly Dragon Escort Agency’s infamous good-for-nothing youngest son. The weakling, Lee Jungryong, will become the best escort warrior in this life!
