An F-rank Hunter. More than that, a useless, pathetic F-rank older brother who’s holding back his younger brother, who’s doing well as an S-rank. The title that was given to me, who regressed after living a shitty life halfheartedly and sapping my younger brother’s life away, The ‘Perfect Caregiver’ Alright then. This time, I’ll just live a low-profile life, keeping to myself while watching over those amazing bastards… …That was what I’d thought, but these S-ranks are… a little weird.
