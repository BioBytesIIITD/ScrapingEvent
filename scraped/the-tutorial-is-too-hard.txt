Gandara’s fusion fantasy novel, ‘The Tutorial is Too Hard’, is now here as a webtoon. One day, amidst a boring life, an invitation message appears before my eyes. [Would you like to enter the tutorial world?] Following it is a difficulty-selection window. [Easy] [Normal] [Hard] [Hell]. I select hell-difficulty without hesitation. And I regret it. I know it said hell-difficulty, but this is just too much.
